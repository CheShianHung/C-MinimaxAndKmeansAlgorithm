# C-MinimaxAndKmeansAlgorithm
The program uses C++ to implement minimax and kmeans cluster classifying algorithms and classifies randomly generated samples, and displays the testing results after each classification. The samples are generated from five circle centers. Each circle center is used to generate ten samples within a given radius. In this case, the five circle centers are hard coded as (6, -6), (-6, -6), (10, 6), (-10, 6), and (0, 10). The distance between two circle centers are all greater than ten. While the program is running, the user can modify several parameters to test the impact on the result. For each program run, a new set of samples will be randomly generated, and the user can test the sample data over and over again through the terminal.
